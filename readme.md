Webpage Modifications
==================

Frameworks used: AngularJS, Angular UI Bootstrap, Bootstrap CSS framework
AngularJS provided the support for a templating tool to update the products dynamically. 
Bootstrap CSS framework provided the support to make the webpage responsive and view easily on mobile device, by laying out the webpage in the form of a grid.


Optimizations/Modifications:
Moved the script tags to bottom of the body section 
Used minified CSS files to reduce load time
Added a bootstrap styled loading indicator that is displayed when the page is being rendered.
Added a custom css class to override bootstrap css for anchor tags.
The text on the page is center aligned.
An x icon from bootstrap is added to each image that removes it from the view when clicked.
An overlay from angular-ui-bootstrap components is used to display the description on hover.




* Familiarize yourself and optimize and improve the code and layout anywhere you see fit. 

* Each product has an attribute named "description". We'd like to update the UI so that whenever you mousover a product, an overlay comes across it with the description. 

* When viewed on a mobile device, the site scrolls left to right. Optimize the layout so that it can be properly viewed on mobile. 

* Add an "X" in the top right corner of each product. When you click on it, have it remove itself from the page. 

* Perform a few style edits: link colors should be #0096ff, The title of the page should be 36 pixels high. The tagline of the page should be 18. Title of each product should be 16 pixels high. The product tagline should be 16. Center everything on the page including titles and the products display. 

* It takes a second or two to load the page. Let the user know that the page is still loading until the page renders.

* Give any thoughts or commentary on the solution here. What things did you/would you do to optimize it. Are there any outside libraries you would use?
